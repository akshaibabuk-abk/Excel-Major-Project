# Excel-Major-Project

Walmart Sales Analysis

This project contains a complete analysis of Walmart’s weekly sales data using Excel. The dataset was cleaned by removing unnecessary columns, renaming headings, fixing data types, and adding new calculated fields such as Year, Month. After cleaning, pivot tables were built to explore sales trends, store performance, department performance, and the impact of holidays and operational factors like Fuel Price, Unemployment and Temperature on sales.

Pivot tables were used to calculate key metrics such as Total Sales, Average Weekly Sales, Holiday Sales, Top Performing Store, Sales by Store, Sales by Department, Yearly Trends, Holiday vs Non-Holiday Sales, Fuel Price vs Sales, and Unemployment vs Sales. These pivot tables served as the source for the final dashboard visuals.

The Excel dashboard includes interactive charts and KPIs such as Sales by Store, Yearly Sales Trend, Department-wise Sales, Holiday vs Non-Holiday Comparison, Fuel Price vs Sales Trend, and Unemployment vs Sales. Slicers for Year, Store, Department, Store Type, and Holiday were added to make the dashboard fully interactive. The final dashboard provides a clear overview of Walmart’s sales performance and how environmental and economic conditions influence customer spending.
